<a name="ECRF">Early Career Researchers Forum</a>
----------------------

The Early Career Researchers Forum (ECRF) will run before the main GISRUK conference, on the afternoon of Tuesday 14th of April and the morning of Wednesday 15th April 2013. This valuable training opportunity will raise awareness and confidence in Early Career Researchers, addressing a range of issues that will help you complete your PhD and get the most from the GISRUK conference. We will cover:

 - What we are and what we do - Ourselves and our own research topics.
 - Your PhD as an elevator pitch - what you do in 30 seconds. 
 - What's a conference for? Getting the most from GISRUK (and other conferences).
 - Networking (& social networking) as ways of getting jobs.
 - Getting Published - An exploration of some of the various routes to publishing research findings and to identify the requirements, opportunities and limitations involved.

<a name="3DGIS">3D GIS Workshop and Tutorial</a>
----------------------

For more information please [download the flyer](./figures/3DGIS.pdf).

### Introduction

No longer bound by traditional 2D physical representations, there a steady shift towards
three-dimensional data (3D) allowing for a less abstract version of the real world. The workshop
aims to provide an introduction to working with 3D GI data as well as raising awareness and
understanding of the capabilities of the third dimension. Attendees will gain experience working
with a variety of 3D packages and plugins including ArcScene, Google Earth, QGIS, Three.js and FME,
learning to handle, process and present data in 3D.

This workshop is being run by Dr Claire Ellul (UCL) and Kelvin Wong (UCL). Claire is a lecturer in
Geographic Information Science (GIS) in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic
Engineering and is the Director of MSc in GISci. Her research interest include 3D GIS, spatial
databases, big data performance optimization and approaches for handling large quantities of spatial
data. Kelvin is a 3D GIS researcher at the Department of Computer Science, and is currently working
in conjunction with Ordnance Survey in developing a new 3D dataset for Great Britain.

### The workshop will provide:

 - An overview of the state of the art in 3D GIS;
 - Experience with handling and processing 3D geographic information;
 - An insight into the future of 3D GIS;
 - A discussion on the challenges 3D GIS faces.

----------------------

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15008199/img/mel-cycle-cent-close.png" style="float:right; width:50%; height:auto;" />

The [GIS for Transport Applications workshop](http://leeds.gisruk.org/gis4ta.html) is organised by the University of Leed's School of Geography in collaboration with the Institute of Transport Studies ([ITS](http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/)). Official sponsors include the Royal Geographical Society ([RGS](http://www.rgs.org/)) via the Transport Geography Research Group ([TGRG](http://tgrg.wordpress.com/)).

The **aim** of this workshop is to showcase the latest methods of GIS analysis in transport and illustrate how to apply these to real-world transport problems.

### Application

 **Application** is [via email](mailto:gyeao@leeds.ac.uk) to [Eusebio Odiari](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/e.odiari). The email should contain an attachment including your name, position and a written statement of around 50 words outlining how you will benefit from the workshop. Also state if you would like to present a map at the conference (see [additional information](http://leeds.gisruk.org/gis4ta.html) for details) and, if so, a short description of the map.

 - **Deadline: Friday 16th January, 2015**
 - **Notification of acceptance: Friday 13th February**
 - **Workshop date: Tuesday 14th April, 2015**
