Workshops
=========

GISRUK will be organising workshops on the day before the conference (Tuesday 14th April) and the
following morning (Wednesday 15th).

See the details below if you would like to register for any of the workshops.

 - [3D GIS Workshop and Tutorial](#3DGIS)
 - [XXXX ESRI](#ESRI)
 - [RGS Transport Geography - Call for Maps](#Transport)


<a name="3DGIS">3D GIS Workshop and Tutorial</a>
----------------------

For more information please [download the flyer](./figures/3DGIS.pdf).

### Introduction

No longer bound by traditional 2D physical representations, there a steady shift towards
three-dimensional data (3D) allowing for a less abstract version of the real world. The workshop
aims to provide an introduction to working with 3D GI data as well as raising awareness and
understanding of the capabilities of the third dimension. Attendees will gain experience working
with a variety of 3D packages and plugins including ArcScene, Google Earth, QGIS, Three.js and FME,
learning to handle, process and present data in 3D.

This workshop is being run by Dr Claire Ellul (UCL) and Kelvin Wong (UCL). Claire is a lecturer in
Geographic Information Science (GIS) in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic
Engineering and is the Director of MSc in GISci. Her research interest include 3D GIS, spatial
databases, big data performance optimization and approaches for handling large quantities of spatial
data. Kelvin is a 3D GIS researcher at the Department of Computer Science, and is currently working
in conjunction with Ordnance Survey in developing a new 3D dataset for Great Britain.

### The workshop will provide:

 - An overview of the state of the art in 3D GIS;
 - Experience with handling and processing 3D geographic information;
 - An insight into the future of 3D GIS;
 - A discussion on the challenges 3D GIS faces.

*Call for maps: deadline - 19th December 2014*

Workshop date: 14th April, 2014

### Aims of the workshop
The aim of this workshop is to showcase and develop growing expertise with Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) in the Transport community, and encourage further engagement of the GIS community in
transport issues.

### Call for maps

Instead of the traditional ‘Call for Papers’, this event calls for maps that people have made.
Entrants will be given a 5 minute slot to describe their map and how it is useful in a session
before lunch.

### Process
Participants are invited to submit short abstracts describing their map and how they would benefit
from the event (around 100 words) to [Eusebio Odiari](mailto:gyeao@leeds.ac.uk) by December 19th 2014. Acceptance will be
confirmed by February 28th 2014.

### Preliminary programme

or three from the options below, morning and afternoon. Speakers to be confirmed (TBC).
