<a name="ECRF">Early Career Researchers Forum</a>
----------------------

The Early Career Researchers Forum (ECRF) will run before the main GISRUK conference, on the afternoon of Tuesday 14th of April and the morning of Wednesday 15th April 2013. This valuable training opportunity will raise awareness and confidence in Early Career Researchers, addressing a range of issues that will help you complete your PhD and get the most from the GISRUK conference. We will cover:

 - What we are and what we do - Ourselves and our own research topics.
 - Your PhD as an elevator pitch - what you do in 30 seconds. 
 - What's a conference for? Getting the most from GISRUK (and other conferences).
 - Networking (& social networking) as ways of getting jobs.
 - Getting Published - An exploration of some of the various routes to publishing research findings and to identify the requirements, opportunities and limitations involved.

<a name="3DGIS">3D GIS Workshop and Tutorial</a>
----------------------

For more information please [download the flyer](./figures/3DGIS.pdf).

### Introduction

No longer bound by traditional 2D physical representations, there a steady shift towards
three-dimensional data (3D) allowing for a less abstract version of the real world. The workshop
aims to provide an introduction to working with 3D GI data as well as raising awareness and
understanding of the capabilities of the third dimension. Attendees will gain experience working
with a variety of 3D packages and plugins including ArcScene, Google Earth, QGIS, Three.js and FME,
learning to handle, process and present data in 3D.

This workshop is being run by Dr Claire Ellul (UCL) and Kelvin Wong (UCL). Claire is a lecturer in
Geographic Information Science (GIS) in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic
Engineering and is the Director of MSc in GISci. Her research interest include 3D GIS, spatial
databases, big data performance optimization and approaches for handling large quantities of spatial
data. Kelvin is a 3D GIS researcher at the Department of Computer Science, and is currently working
in conjunction with Ordnance Survey in developing a new 3D dataset for Great Britain.

### The workshop will provide:

 - An overview of the state of the art in 3D GIS;
 - Experience with handling and processing 3D geographic information;
 - An insight into the future of 3D GIS;
 - A discussion on the challenges 3D GIS faces.

<a name="Transport">RGS Transport Geography - Call for Maps</a>
----------------------

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15008199/img/mel-cycle-cent-close.png" style="float:right; width:50%; height:auto;" />

The RGS Transport Geography Research Group (TGRG) is proud to announce a _call for maps_

 - Application deadline ([via email](mailto:gyeao@leeds.ac.uk)):
 Friday 16th January, 2015
 - Workshop date: Tuesday 14th April, 2015 
 

### Aims of the workshop
The aim of this workshop is to showcase and develop growing expertise with Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) in the Transport community, and encourage further engagement of the GIS community in
transport issues.

### Call for maps

Instead of the traditional ‘Call for Papers’, this event calls for maps that people have made.
Entrants will be given a 5 minute slot to describe their map and how it is useful in a session
before lunch.

### Process

Participants are invited to submit short abstracts describing their map and how they would benefit
from the event (around 100 words) to [Eusebio Odiari](mailto:gyeao@leeds.ac.uk) by 16th January 2015. Acceptance will be confirmed by Friday 13th February.

<a name="ESRI">ESRI GIS Workshop</a>
----------------------

### Aims of the workshop

The aim of this workshop will be to introduce users to some of the latest GIS tools offered by the
ArcGIS suite. It will include lessons on how to build interactive web apps using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS
Online, and how to easily create geospatial code use the ArcGIS Developer toolkit.

### Programme

*Tuesday 14th April*

_Interactive web apps with coding using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online_

14:00 - 14:15   Arrive and register

14:15 – 14:30   What’s new in the ArcGIS Platform (ArcGIS Pro / 3D / CityEngine  / ArcGIS Online / Collector App)

14:30 – 15:30   Introduction to ArcGIS Pro including small exercise

15:30 - 15:45   Tea / Coffee break

15:45 – 17:00   Creating interactive web apps without coding through ArcGIS Online and Web App Builder


*Wednesday 15th April*

_Geospatial coding made easy with ArcGIS Developer toolkit_

10:00 - 10:30   Arrival, coffee etc.

10:30 - 11:00   Introduction, what is an API and SDK? What platforms do we support? What is possible with our APIs and SDKs? What is the REST API and why is it important?

11:00 - 11:30   Sign up for a developer account, create application credentials, and create a feature service in developer account. 

11:30 - 11:45   Tea / Coffee

11:45 - 13:15   Start using the JavaScript API; HTML page setup, CSS map setup, putting a map on the page, changing the basemap, changing center point/zoom distance. Next add a 2D hosted feature service from yesterday to our map, explain how to change symbology. Finally do some analysis and produce a heatmap.
