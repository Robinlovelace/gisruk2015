title: "Transport for GIS Applications"

The GIS for Transport Applications workshop ([#GIS4TA](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23gis4ta&src=typd) for short!) is organised by the University of Leed's School of Geography in collaboration with the Institute of Transport Studies ([ITS](http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/)). Official sponsors include the Royaly Geographical Society ([RGS](http://www.rgs.org/)) via the Transport Geography Research Group ([TGRG](http://tgrg.wordpress.com/)).

## Introduction

Transport is a field that relies on high quality geographical information. The storage, analysis, visualisation and modelling of roads, pathways, and vehicle flows is critical to understanding any transport system. This makes geographical information systems (GIS) a critical component of the transport researcher's toolkit.

## Aim of the workshop

The aim of this workshop is to showcase and develop growing expertise with Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) in the Transport community, and encourage further engagement of the GIS community in
transport issues.

## Who should attend?

This workshop is intended for two main groups:

1. GIS users wanting to apply their skills to transport applications
2. Transport researchers and planners with some experience of GIS

The workshop is not intended for GIS novices and will contain practicals that will assume some experience with desktop and command-line software. Working knowledge of QGIS and R is desirable.

## Software

The focus will be on open-source programs because these are free and accessible to all workshop attendees, and are becoming increasingly used by governmental and private transport planning organisations. Participants should have QGIS and R preinstalled on their laptops before attending.

## Call for maps

Instead of the traditional 'Call for Papers', this event has an optional 'Calls for Maps' These can be any type of transport-related map that attendees have created. Entrants who enter a map (and accompanying description of up-to 50 words) will be given a 5 minute slot to describe their map and how it is useful in a session
before lunch.

## Application

To **apply** to attend the conference, a short (around 50 words) summary of your interest in #GIS4TA should be sent to [Eusebio Odiari](mailto:gyeao@leeds.ac.uk) by 16th January 2015. Preference will be given to those who provide a strong justification for attending the conference, and to those who will present their own maps. Acceptance will be confirmed by Friday 13th February.

### Important dates

 - **Call for maps deadline: Friday 16th January**
 - **Notification of acceptance: Friday 13th February**
 - **Workshop date: Tuesday 14th April**
