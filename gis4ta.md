The GIS for Transport Applications workshop ([#GIS4TA](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23gis4ta&src=typd) for short!) is organised by the University of Leed's School of Geography in collaboration with the Institute of Transport Studies ([ITS](http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/)). Official sponsors include the Royal Geographical Society ([RGS](http://www.rgs.org/)) via the Transport Geography Research Group ([TGRG](http://tgrg.wordpress.com/)).

## Resources

To ensure this workshop's longevity and usefulness to people who cannot attend, we've set up an online repository for links, code and even data.
Check it out here:

[github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA)

## Introduction

Transport is a field that relies on high quality geographical information. The storage, analysis, visualisation and modelling of roads, pathways, and vehicle flows is critical to understanding any transport system. This makes GIS a critical component of the transport researcher's toolkit.
The workshop will demonstrate methods of flow analysis, route allocation and processing of large GPS datasets.

## Aim of the workshop

The aim of this workshop is to showcase and develop growing expertise with Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) in the Transport community, and encourage further engagement of the GIS community in
transport issues.

## Who should attend?

This workshop is intended for two main groups:

1. GIS users wanting to apply their skills to transport applications
2. Transport researchers and planners with some experience of GIS

The workshop is not intended for GIS novices and will contain practicals that will assume some experience with desktop and command-line software. Working knowledge of QGIS and R is desirable.

## Software

The focus will be on open-source programs because these are free and accessible to all workshop attendees, and are becoming increasingly used by governmental and private transport planning organisations. Participants should have recent versions of QGIS and R preinstalled on their laptops.

## Call for maps

Instead of the traditional 'Call for Papers', this event has an optional 'Calls for Maps' These can be any type of transport-related map that attendees have created. Entrants who would like to present a map (signalled in the application, with accompanying description) will be given a short slot to describe their map and how it is useful in a session before lunch. The 'best map', voted by a panel, will win a £50 cash prize.

## Application

Application to the conference is via email to [Eusebio Odiari](mailto:gyeao@leeds.ac.uk) by 16th January 2015. The application should be sent as a separate word or pdf file which contains:

- Name, title and position.
- A short (around 50 words) summary of your interest in #GIS4TA.
- Contact details.
- Description of map if you are submitting one (optional).

Please use the [application template](http://leeds.gisruk.org/GIS4TA_Application.doc), which contains these fields.

Preference will be given to those who provide a strong justification for attending the conference, and to those who will present their own maps. Acceptance will be confirmed by Friday 13th February. The workshop will cost £20 to attend.

### Important dates

 - **Call for maps deadline: Friday 16th January**
 - **Notification of acceptance: Friday 13th February**
 - **Workshop date: Tuesday 14th April**
