The study applies innovative approach and explores high-resolution spatial data on terrorist attacks in the region and more specifically on the ethnic dimension of the issue. The use of Klier-McMillen linearized Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) spatial logit model unveils intriguing connections between terrorist activities and ethnic composition of the region and allows the identification and modelling of fine-scale interactions between various covariates and the occurrence and intensity of terrorist attacks in Central Asia.",

        "abstract": "The geographic analysis of health or crime events, such as the location of prostitution (and related diseases), the interaction between drugs and the built environment (including overdoses and important spaces), and different expressions of street-level violence present a complex problem often limited by data availability. Current trends in both health and crime analysis are to break apart the spatial nuance within a hotspot in terms of micro places. The justification is compelling, it is important to contextualize the buildings, streets, spaces and experiences of those who live in the problematic area. This poster will present a spatial video approach that can be used to capture typically unavailable ephemeral fine scale data, across multiple time periods for a dynamic urban landscape, and from multiple \u201cexperts\u201d in the form of geonarratives, which is an environment inspired dialogue. The insights of residents, volunteers and professionals can be used to describe the context and importance of buildings, streets, corners, and the perceived impact of different interventions. This poster will present a standardized methodology for what until now has largely been an experimental concept. Using Akron, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California as study spaces, multiple geonarratives will be combined to provide a comprehensive bottom-up understanding of the crime-health nexus. Perspectives from community police, ex-offenders, and local residents will narrate the landscape before their insights are dissected for spatial content and then mapped in association with more traditional data layers (such as 911 call for service). This poster will describe the methodology involved, the protocols that will result in a successful geonarrative, and how these spatially encoded textual streams can be mapped and analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Commuting involves the regular movement of an individual from a place residence to a place of work and back again. The vast majority of individuals in employment are involved in making a commuting journey on a regular, often daily, basis. This behaviour is a relatively important (and often much disliked) part of many people\u2019s routines, with a direct and indirect impact on their lives. One of the key sources of information about commuting intensities and spatial patterns is the population census in the United Kingdom, through which travel to work characteristics are captured resulting in large and complex data sets that are disseminated by the census agencies as aggregate counts (i.e. stocks of commuters based on where they live) or interaction counts (i.e. flows of commuters from where they live to where they work).  \nA number of commuting variables (relating to mode of travel) from the 2011 Census have been released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of the Aggregate Statistics for England and Wales, whilst the flow data are published independently for the UK as a whole as Special Workplace Statistics (SWS) or Special Travel Statistics in Scotland (STS). \nThis paper reports on analyses of these data sets at two levels. Firstly, data from the Aggregate Statistics (Tables KS015 and CT0015) are used to explore changes in overall commuting intensities and also proportions of commuters by mode of travel (including homeworking) at district level across England and Wales.  These data are valuable in providing evidence of stocks of commuters according to where they are usually resident but do not provide information about their workplace destinations.  A second set of analyses using interaction flow data from the Origin-Destination Statistics will be reported which identify patterns of commuting within the Leeds City Region (LCR).  These data provide counts of commuting outflows from residential areas, inflows to workplace areas and flows between each residential origin and workplace destination. In this case, we will use the LCR as our geographical study area and examine changes in flows at different spatial scales, depending on which flow data from the 2011 Census are released in an accessible form.  Choropleth maps are used to show variations in the commuting rates and intensities by district across the nation, whilst flow maps are used to show variations in the magnitudes of commuting flows between the districts and smaller areas at the local level.\nUltimately, the findings from the research will support those tasked in local authorities and regional agencies with the responsibility to supply and maintain transport networks for those who require them.\n",

However, aggregate crime work often fails to connect to the individual-level of the offender, and it is difficult to link broader crime patterns to offending at an individual-level. The current project seeks to address these problems through developing an Agent-Based simulation model of residential burglary, based upon semi-structured interviews with offenders from Leeds and burglary offence data provided by West Yorkshire Police. Using this data, heterogeneous offender groups will be identified based on their behavioural preferences and target selection criteria, using a quantitative Latent Class (cluster-based) Analysis. These groups will provide distinct information on offending patterns and journeys to crime, to reflect the heterogeneity of offenders within Leeds. The simulation model developed will explore the impact of different crime reduction initiatives and Policing styles with different offender groups, whilst assessing the extent to which offending by different offender groups may be predicted, therefore enabling validation of the model.",

        "abstract": "Various papers and strategies studying urban mobility and movement patterns are reviewed and, categorised according to the mathematical discipline of the models employed. This has enabled the development of a structured framework for studying urban mobility and movement patterns, while taking advantage of the opportunities that big data presents. \nThe choice of strategy for investigating urban mobility and movement is dependent on the type of data and, the particular problem, questions or situation that needs answers. The various types of Big Data come with volume, velocity, variety and veracity, and corresponding ever widening range of solution strategies, calling for a systematic approach based on an objective framework. \nThe particular opportunity that today\u2019s data analyst has is the freedom to introduce a new strategy better describing the situation being modelled, and then exploiting the flexibility in today\u2019s simulation tools, not limited or constrained as in the past, by purely mathematical concerns. That ability or skill to revise simulation code to suite a particular modelling scenario is a main strength.  \nFor illustration purposes, an Agent Based Model (ABM) is used to simulate a railway infrastructure and its populated environs, and data is measured at various points to simulate types of consumer Big Data typically available within economic sector operators. This data is used to review solution techniques adopted in urban mobility papers, while developing solution concepts for illustration to sector operators, with a view to garnering support for the release of real-life data for future research.",

The potential impact of these insight derived from these data is no more significant than in the developing country context, where existing data collection infrastructure is limited or non-existent. In this research, mobile phone data for Dakar, Senegal is used to better understand urban activity and mobility dynamics. To achieve this, a clustering method is introduced that extracts the spatial distribution, and the temporal characteristics, of the activities of individual mobile phone users. With this classification of individual locations of activity, citywide trends in activity and mobility over time are derived. The paper concludes in discussing the potential and limitations of this approach, and the outlook for associated analyses that employ mobile phone trace data.",

        "abstract": "Fine-scale and longitudinal geospatial analysis of health risks in challenging urban areas is often limited by the lack of available spatial data. Underlying population counts, residential context, and associated causative factors such as standing water or trash locations are often missing unless collected through logistically difficult surveys. The lack of spatial context also hinders designing intervention strategies structured around analytical insights. This paper offers a spatial video approach that can be used to improve analysis and involve participatory collaborations. The case study presented involves water-related risks in post-earthquake Haiti.  Spatial video is used to collect environmental data such as standing water, trash accumulation, presence of dogs, cohort specific population characteristics and general activity spaces. These data are digitized into Google Earth and then coded and analyzed in a GIS using different local area spatial analysis methods. These layers can easily be temporally updated to capture fine scale dynamism in the landscape. An example is provided of how these risk maps were used to guide water testing strategies in a coastal town previously impacted by cholera. The poster will describe how the simplicity and flexibility of the technique means data can be collected by vehicle, by boat, or using a hand-held unit. All data is archived through \u201cthe map\u201d, allowing for easy access which facilitates training, intervention planning and coding-analysis validation. To summarize, spatial video is a tool that can be used in most environments to improve local area health analysis and intervention. The process is rapid and can be repeated in study sites through time to track spatio-temporal dynamics of the communities. Its simplicity also encourages local participatory collaborations.",

Networks with significant properties are examined in more detail. We use this method to investigate the placement of hillforts (nodes) in the Gwent region of south-east Wales, UK. We are able to determine distances that support significant transitions in network structure that could have significant archaeological validity.",

The framework identifies migration variables internal to a country, international migration to and from a country and its constituent regions and international migration between other countries. These different types of migration can be represented in projection models as flows (migration numbers), flows projected by a time series model, migration transmission rates multiplied by the origin population at risk, migration admission rates multiplied by the destination population at a risk, or through an explanatory model. The arguments for and against each migration projection model are discussed through an analysis of 16 projection examples linked to published studies. The importance of understanding the forces affecting migration at origin and destination is stressed. Simulation experiments are carried out for a UK population disaggregated by the ethnicity, testing model results against 2001-2011 estimates. The paper shows how a proper understanding of the spatial context is needed for successful population projections.",

        "abstract": "Population projections are rarely evaluated. Yet evaluations are an essential means for understanding how projections depart from reality. In this paper we describe a set of local population projections by ethnicity for England, based on the 2001 Census population, which can be compared after 10 years with the results of the 2011 Census. We examine the differences at national and local levels and for broad and detailed aggregate groups. Some differences are small such as the all group population of England but others are very large such as the populations of \u201cOther\u201d Ethnicity, indicating considerable uncertainty about the components of change estimated for 2001 to 2006 and the projection assumptions for 2006 to 2011. By looking at the ethnic-local differences by age and by geographic pattern we can make some deductions about the sources of error. These lessons enable us to plan a set of simulations with a new version of our projection model over 2001 to 2011 that can isolate more precisely the reasons for the 2011 projection versus 2011 census differences. This analysis will help improve the next round of ethnic population projections upon which we are currently engaged.",

In short they lack appropriate contextualisation. Moreover, though motor vehicle theft (MVT) has accounted for the largest proportion of property crime incidents for decades in Saudi Arabia, particularly in Riyadh, to date few studies have been conducted to investigate this crime. Those that have, primarily focused on the characteristics of car thieves, and most have overlooked any spatio-temporal distribution of MVT incidents. The overall findings of an initial data analysis indicate that spatial patterns of MVT in Riyadh are both more clustered than randomly distributed events and statistically significant. This preliminary work suggests that this phenomenon needs to be further examined in greater depth and additionally contextualised within the theoretical frameworks developed in environmental criminology theories. These two approaches combined will provide a more detailed understanding of the relationship between MVT incidents and the characteristics of neighbourhoods.",

The results revealed that the highest occurrence of 2,220 cases was in 2009 while year 2011 recorded the least cases of 1,179 across the state. It as further revealed that Birnin Kebbi LGA with a population of 268,620 recorded the highest cases of 1,639. However, Suru LGA with population of 148,474 recorded only 70 cases over the period. In conclusion, TB cases were unevenly distributed but high cluster rates were identified in the four emirate headquarters of Born in Kebbi, Argungu, Yuri and Zuru. Increasing the number of diagnostic and treatment centers were recommended in order to reduce the number of cases across the state.",

The matching processes link the historical addresses to the contemporary addresses by exact and fuzzy matching algorithms. Apart from geocoding the historical addresses, we also produce pseudo registration district boundaries using the pilot historical addresses from vital event records in 1900, 1930, 1950 and 1951.",

However, this model has not been widely applied to crime data and many open questions remain about how best to implement it in a real setting. In this work, we consider a range of practical implementation details relating to the application of SEPP models to real crime data. We propose a robust protocol that optimises the performance of the method, and suggest guidelines for parameter selection.",

The main objective of the analysis was to estimate the retail catchment areas for town centres in England as a function of relative attractiveness and distance from potential customers, while taking into account the effects of competition among the retail destinations. This was achieved by relaxing the areal constraint for spatial interactions, allowing thus the relative size and attractiveness of the town centres to define the scale at which competition might occur.

Comparisons were made using approaches based on Euclidean distances and more sophisticated accessibility measures that utilise travel distances and times: the latter incorporating measures of supply and demand by using innovative extensions to the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area method (E2SFCA).  To illustrate the sensitivity of findings from applying such models with a range of data sources, accessibility to secondary schools was calculated for Output Areas in South Wales using an E2SFCA plug-in to ArcGIS.  By using different permutations of spatial data, for both the supply- and demand-side parameters in such models, differences in FCA scores were sought in order to comment on the usability of such data sources.  Preliminary conclusions are made on the appropriateness of such data sets in relation to different types of network-based accessibility modelling tasks.",

The models assume that police journeys are undertaken as series of \u201ctopics\u201d, which are inferred from vehicle GPS data using a widely used topic modelling technique called latent Dirichlet allocation.

Policy makers are subsequently, beginning to engage with the idea that the built environment may be a contributing factor to the obesity epidemic. Indeed, public health professionals in the UK are now encouraged to address the prevalence of fast food outlets in their area to support healthier lifestyles.1  \n\nNeighborhood food and physical activity built environments have been labelled obesogenic; facilitating an over-consumption of energy-dense, nutrient poor foods at the expense of minimal energy; thus increasing overweight and obesity. Despite an increasing policy focus, identifying associations between exposure to an obesogenic environment and increased body weight has proved challenging and the evidence base remains equivocal. A recent systematic review2 found that of those studies examining these exposures in relation to increasing body weight, fewer than half reported positive associations. Further, even fewer of the reviewed studies that were included were conducted in England. The evidence base is therefore not strongly placed at present to support interventions into politically difficult modifications of alleged obesogenic environments.\n\nDespite a lack of scientific support, modification of the obesogenic environment currently represents a key focus of local authority health policy. It is an attractive population level intervention to limit risk factors conducive to obesity. Briefly, genetic evolution has been wholly unable to match the rapidity of the environmental and societal transitions made within the 21st century. Therefore, individuals currently pay an overwhelming amount of attention to override their natural habits due to the environmental cues of everyday contemporary life. For example, the high energy densities of many fast foods challenge human appetite control systems with conditions for which they were never designed.3 By influencing the \u2018default\u2019 option in the obesogenic environment such as the proximity of fast food outlets there may be some potential to affect dietary intake and ultimately obesity.  \n\nThe \u2018default option\u2019 for an individual may be influenced somewhat by the obesogenic environment however; some population groups for example low socioeconomic status (SES) may be more vulnerable than others to the effects of the obesogenic environment. Individual- and area-level SES measures are independently related to obesity. It is increasingly important to consider both individual- and area-level measures of SES using multi-level modelling. Lower area level SES with a greater density of fast food outlets may amplify individual risk factors for obesity such as low income, education or absence of transport; a phenomena known as deprivation amplification. Despite the apparent consequences of individuals operating within obesogenic environments the research to date has insufficiently and inconsistently addressed the issue. \n\nIt is interesting that despite lobbying from policy, contemporary evidence on the obesogenic environment is essentially in its infancy. It may be unsurprising that those associations linking exposure to food and physical activity environments to weight status are at present equivocal. Besides, comparisons between studies are made difficult by a US-centric evidence base and should be interpreted with care. England in any case has a very different environmental temperament to the US yet, this important distinction has rarely explicitly been raised. Lastly, few studies have data on both the food and physical activity environment. Therefore, there is little understanding of which aspect of the neighborhood is comparatively stronger in predicting obesity and thus offering greatest policy impact. In addition to these considerations, the lack of associations identified in studies could be explained through other limitations.\n\nDue to the infancy of the evidence, much is cross-sectional limiting the ability to draw causal inference. Furthermore, an individual\u2019s neighbourhood (which in turn defines exposure) is often arbitrary defined for instance, a 400m circular buffer around a participants home. This definition rarely has any theoretical underpinning as to the size or shape of the neighbourhood. Neighbourhoods used within obesogenic environment research are inconsistently defined and rarely represent the locations used to actually buy food. Encouraging a range of measures at present is the best estimate. Importantly, neighbourhoods and exposure to the obesogenic environment often extend beyond home neighbourhood to the work or commute neighbourhood. However, research predominantly focuses on just the residential environment. Further research is needed to inform evidence based policy to tackle the obesity epidemic.         \n\n1.1 Aims \nThis study aims to examine: \ni)\tThe spatial distribution of the food and physical activity (obesogenic) environment across Yorkshire by gender, deprivation and ethnicity \nii)\tThe impact of exposure to the food and physical activity (obesogenic) environment on an individual\u2019s overweight or obesity\n\n2.0 Methods \n\n2.1 Study Design & Data Sources\nThe STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) recommendations were used to add methodological rigour. This large (n=27,806) multi-level and cross-sectional study represents collaboration with Sheffield University\u2019s Yorkshire Health Study (YHS). Following ethical approval participants were contacted through consenting general practitioner surgeries (response rate; 15.9%). Relevant exposure metrics of the physical activity and nutrition environment were then computed in ArcGIS (V10.2) using the UK Ordnance Survey Points of Interest (PoI) dataset.\n\n2.2 Exposure Variables \nParticipant\u2019s homes were mapped by postcode using ArcGIS. Food outlets PoI\u2019s were categorised into supermarkets, takeaways and convenience or other retail. PA facility PoI\u2019s were included as a whole category. The density of PoI\u2019s (both food and PA) was then calculated by placing circular buffers (100m, 400m, 800m, 1000m, 1600m and 2000m) on home postcode locations. Proximity was represented by calculating straight line distance from home postcode to the nearest PoI (food and PA). Further, the quantity of green space was represented at the Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) and Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) the individual lives in. Briefly, a LSOA and MSOA are UK Census geographies designed for small-area statistical analysis. Finally, rural or urban classification for each MSOA and LSOA will be obtained from the Commission for Rural Communities Framework 2004.\n\n2.3 Outcome Variables \nOriginally, this study represents weight status (dependent variable) through multiple outcomes. \n\nBody mass index (BMI) - self-reported weight (kg) was divided by height (cm) squared. Participants were then split into categories of underweight (<18.50), healthy weight (18.50 \u2013 24.99), overweight (25.00 \u2013 29.99) and obese (>30.00) respectively. \nWaist Circumference (WC) \u2013 self-reported WC (cm) was categorised into no, high and very high increased risk of health complications based on gender specific cut-points. \n\n2.4 Covariate Variables \nAge, gender, ethnicity and SES were collected from the participants and the highest level of education was used as a measure of individual level SES.\n\n2.5 Bias & Missing Data\nData validation was an extremely thorough process. Firstly, checked by all parties involved in the collaboration the missing data was then explored (by the first author) dependent upon the type, amount and distribution of missing data. Based on the large sample size, data was included only if postcode, gender, age, ethnicity and either BMI or WC are present, age was greater than 18 years of age and the postcode lay within the Yorkshire boundary. This resulted in 25 706 and 25 294 cases for BMI and WC respectively.  \n\n2.6 Statistical Methods \nThe dataset has a multi-level hierarchical structure which consists of adults nested within neighbourhoods. Based on BMI two binary variables of i) overweight and obese or not and ii) obese or not were created for logistical analysis. A further logistical analysis for WC will be carried out for i) increased risk or not and ii) substantially increased risk or not. Subsequently, multi-level modelling using two level hierarchical logistical models will be used determine variance at different levels using the dependent variables of BMI and WC. Predictors will be sequentially added to models and possible interactions between explanatory variables will be explored. \n\n2.7 Strategic Alignment \nRelating back to the strategic aims of GISRUK, this project represents interdisciplinary collaboration between The School of Public Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at Sheffield University and The Centre for Active Lifestyles at Leeds Beckett University. Further, the project is led by a PhD student supported by Senior Lecturers and Research Associates from both institutions. The goal is to respond to the urgent need to identify evidence based policy to tackle the obesity epidemic. Further, with the help of GIS the project aims to guide long-term town planning, policy change and redesign of existing urban environments to maximise physical activity, nutrition and minimise sedentary behaviour and obesity; all determinants of human health.\n\n1.

        "abstract": "Assessment of social vulnerability under three flood scenarios using an open source vulnerability index\n\nGarbutt K 1, Ellul C 2 and Fujiyama T 2\n\n1 Centre for Urban Sustainability and Resilience, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London \n2 Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London\n\nNovember 12, 2014\n\nSummary\n\nThis paper utilises an open source flood vulnerability index to assess changes in social vulnerability within the English county of Norfolk under three flood scenarios. Open source demographics data is combined with flood zone data and GIS analysis of accessibility to key services to create the flood vulnerability index. The impact of flooding was found to be disproportionately distributed amongst those areas recording a high level of social vulnerability before flood risk was included. Analysis suggests those at risk of flooding are more likely to be elderly, poor and have long-term health problems.\n\n\nKEYWORDS: Vulnerability, Open Source, Demographics, Flood Risk, Vulnerability Index\n\n\n1.\tIntroduction\n\nFloods pose an environmental and fiscal challenge for the United Kingdom. More than five million homes and businesses are at risk of flooding (DEFRA, 2013) and an average of \u00a31 billion in flood damages is incurred each year (EA, 2013). Flooding can have a far-reaching and long-lasting impact on a community (Bennet, 1970; Milojevic et al., 2011). Those in society most often deemed vulnerable: the elderly, poor or unemployed, for example, often see their level of vulnerability increase during hazard events as both risk and exposure increases. The features of a person\u2019s life that makes them vulnerable are often intensified: the loss of income following a flood exacerbating poverty, for example. A greater knowledge of the spatial distribution of vulnerability within communities is therefore key to understanding how a population may be impacted by a hazard event (Cutter & Emrich, 2006). Highlighting those who are exposed to a hazard, as well as those who are potentially more vulnerable due to their circumstances, can aid emergency response and risk reduction strategies (Nelson, et al., 2007).\n\nThis paper utilises an open source vulnerability index (OS-VI), previously created by the authors (Garbutt et al., 2014), to assess changes in social vulnerability within the English county of Norfolk under three flood scenarios. Norfolk has a substantial coastline and a lengthy history of flooding, including being severely impacted by the 1953 North Sea Flood, as well as a substantial elderly (23%) and potentially vulnerable population (DCLG, 2011). The revised OS-VI, which incorporates updated demographics data recently released by the Office for National Statistics, provides a place-based assessment of vulnerability and when combined with flood risk scenarios can provide non-governmental organisations (NGO) and local authorities with valuable context and guidance when planning for or responding to flood emergencies.\n\n\n2.\tBackground\n\nThe British Red Cross (BRC) work throughout the UK and internationally preparing communities for disasters, supporting post-disaster recovery, delivering and teaching first aid and assisting individuals with health and social care needs. Since 2010 the BRC has operated a Mapping Team that utilises Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and the growing wealth of spatial data to support the organization\u2019s work. For the BRC, vulnerability analysis and mapping provides context to hazards and provides information that can guide service delivery and the provision of community resilience building programs.\n\nThe development of vulnerability indices is an increasingly common method to capture the geographical distribution of vulnerability across regions countries or sub-national areas (see: Cutter et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2012). Further, such indices are increasingly being coupled with hazard assessments to create integrated risk analyses (Siagian, et al., 2013). To produce such practical analysis and assessment of vulnerability, many socio-economic elements that influence vulnerability must be assigned measureable numeric indicators (Atteslander et al., 2008). However, past work on measuring and mapping vulnerability has been limited by a focus on income-related indicators, a lack of consideration of accessibility, the production of large resolution indices (county or country scale), and the reliance on proprietary data and/or methodologies, with limited attention paid to open source data (Garbutt et al., 2014).\n\n3.\tMethodology \n\nThe authors previously created an Open Source Vulnerability Index (OS-VI), a deductive indicator-based index that incorporated 53 different vulnerability indicators shown to influence vulnerability (Garbutt et al., 2014). Unlike many vulnerability indices, the OS-VI was produced using open source demographic data only and incorporated indicators of flood risk as well as the loss of capabilities and access to key services (health facilities and food stores) when determining an area\u2019s level of social vulnerability. The OS-VI provided a mechanism whereby quality open source data on the core drivers of vulnerability could be used to create a vulnerability index with a sufficiently small resolution to examine vulnerability at the community level. Here, the OS-VI is used as a starting point to examine the impact of three flood scenarios (presented in table 1) and is supplemented with spatial analysis to generate four flood vulnerability indicators for each of the 539 Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) within Norfolk (see figure 1).\n\nTable 1 Flood Scenarios (adapted from Environment Agency, 2014)\n\nScenario\tProbability\nVery Low (FZ1) \tLand assessed as having less than 1 in 1,000 (0.1%) annual probability of flooding. This scenario is described as an \u2018extreme flood\u2019.\nLow (FZ2)\tLand assessed as having between a 1 in 200 (0.5%) annual probability of flooding.\nModerate (FZ3)\tLand assessed as having a 1 in 100 (1%) or greater annual probability of flooding.\n\nThe results of the four flood vulnerability indicators are combined with the social vulnerability indicators within the original OS-VI to produce an overall vulnerability score for each LSOA in Norfolk. The results are mapped and the changes in vulnerability examined.\n\n\nFigure 1 Flow Chart outlining the methodology used to develop the flood vulnerability OS-VI presented herein. 1) Use of original OS-VI; 2) production of flood vulnerability indicators; 3) combination of both to create a Flood Vulnerability OS-VI for each flood scenario under analysis.\n\n4.\tResults\n\nAs can be seen in figures 2 and 3, the major clusters of LSOA with high vulnerability ratings across the original OS-VI and all three flood scenarios loosely match those areas with greater exposure to the flood hazard. Although changes are slight, vulnerability ratings of areas already deemed highly vulnerable within the original OS-VI were found to increase as the impact and extent of flooding increased across the three flood scenarios examined. The impact of flooding was found to be disproportionately distributed amongst those LSOA recording a high or moderate-high vulnerability rating: roughly 66% of LSOA with the majority of their area within the flood zone and 76% with their Centroid within a flood zone recorded a high or moderate-high vulnerability rating.\n\nOf those highlighted as at risk of flooding, our analysis suggests residents are also more likely to live alone and be aged 65+; have an income below the national median; lack central heating in their home; have bad or very bad health and limited actions due to a long-term health problem/disability; provide in excess of 50 hours care to another per week. An underlying relationship between the presence of flood hazard in an area and its socio-economic and health vulnerabilities is therefore suggested, although the relationship is unclear and further study is needed.\n\nIn addition, analysis of changes in accessibility found that those populations highlighted above are also more likely to live in an area where travel time to key services is in excess of the national average. Travel time to key services was severely impacted under all flood scenarios. For example, under scenario FZ1, the local authority of Kings Lynn recorded a 223% increase in average travel time, from 21 minutes to 68 minutes, and the local authority of Great Yarmouth, which was identified as being the most vulnerable local authority in Norfolk as well as the most affected by flooding, recorded 43% of its LSOA as completely cut-off from healthcare facilities.\n\n\nFigure 2 Vulnerability Indices. 1) Original OS-VI; 2) Vulnerability Index under FZ1 scenario; 3) Vulnerability Index under FZ2 scenario; 4) Vulnerability Index under FZ3 scenario.\n\n\nFigure 3 Vulnerability Index under FZ3 \u2018extreme flood\u2019 scenario featuring flood data overlay.\n\n5.\tDiscussion \n\nThe results presented above demonstrate the potential cascading impact of a flood hazard as it impacts an already vulnerable population: exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities, limiting capabilities and restricting accessibility and access to key services. The OS-VI and its use here to examine the potential impact of flooding was found to be a useful supplementary tool for the BRC, with the measurement and visualisation of vulnerability and potential hazard impact providing context and aiding response service planning and capability assessment.\n\nTo ensure its use by the BRC, open data and software was used exclusively to reduce organizational expenditure and provide quality data that can be freely disseminated. The demographic data used was deemed the best available at the scale and resolution required and the GIS software used, QGIS, was also deemed appropriate for the analysis required. One limitation noted was the assumption that, under each flood scenario, all roads within the flood zone would be impassable and thus roads and key services within each zone were restricted. This was due to the lack of flood depth information within the available flood data. Future work would use topographical data and digital elevation models to calculate flood depth and improve the accessibility metrics within the indices.\n\nIt was also noted that the discrete county boundary used to restrict analysis to within the county of Norfolk likely led to limitations within accessibility routing as key services outside of the study zone may have been a viable option if the restriction was not in place. At a county level the analysis remains valid, but for organisations like the BRC who regularly work across boundaries, future work will address this scale effect by examining service locality and the catchment zones of neighbouring services that are utilised by populations within the study zone.\n\n6.\tConclusion\n\nThe approach presented here utilises vulnerability indices built upon quality open data to examine the potential impact of flooding on social vulnerability. The original OS-VI takes into account a broad range of social and economic indicators to highlight hotspots of social vulnerability. The addition of varying hazard scenarios allows for the examination of how vulnerability changes during an emergency. The indices produced can be extended to the national level whilst retaining the relatively small LSOA resolution. The methods used are scalable and adaptable and the use of open data allows all parties involved to easily coordinate and share information, potentially improving local knowledge and reducing vulnerability (Trujillo et al. 2000). The OS-VI and its use here to examine flood risk represents the first step in imagining a dynamic and customisable disaster risk platform that can be updated as new data is made available and adapted and utilised by the BRC and others to identify pockets of vulnerable communities and improve emergency response. \n\n7.\tBiography\n\nKurtis Garbutt is a postgraduate research engineer at the Centre for Urban Sustainability & Resilience at University College London.

The empirical basis used to explore this question is a couple of national-level datasets on a specific topic: bicycle paths in the UK. Open Street Map data represents the crowd-sourced model; Ordnance Survey's Urban Paths layer represents the centralised model.  To assess the quality of each dataset, an array of tests was used, from narrow tests of accuracy against aerial photography, to more subjective tests of usability and practical utility. Overall it was found that the OSM data model won on the majority of criteria. However, it must be noted that this is a niche area. If the crowd-sourced data model is to triumph in more mainstream areas it needs to ensure much greater community 'buy-in', for example through compulsory engagement with Open Street Map for educational and citizenship purposes at school.\n",

Here, we examine GPS traces of police vehicle movement in a major UK city in order to quantify precisely the patrol activity applied to each street segment. This is then compared against crime data to test, and estimate the magnitude of, the deterrent effect of patrolling.",

We embed SQL date functions into table view queries, using an open source database management system, to automatically calculate the ages of ecological observations in real time. In turn, the age attributes are then used in ecological analysis and monitoring applications, such as prioritising ecological survey efforts and estimating resilience to disturbance events. We conclude that the incorporation of temporally dynamic attributes in ecological datasets can help to reduce unnecessary development constraints, delays and expense. ",

This research describes a first attempt at addressing this deficit, documenting a 3D Web GIS with the ability to select, edit, 3D buffer, measure and retrieve attributes. A small user evaluation was undertaken to assess aspects such as usability, consistency and responsiveness. The system developed was implemented using Three.js as a frontend 3D framework and PostGIS as a backend database. The GIS was successful in its execution but detected some issues in requirement of addressing in order to progress. It concludes with recommendations to improve performance and go further with 3D editing.",

The data consists of winter daily precipitation values obtained from a Regional Climate Model, the RACMO2/KNMI, for the period 1971-2000. The constrained clustering method is implemented by using three different linkages, single, complete and average, and for three different cluster numbers, 10, 20 and 30. Average and complete linkage both performed well, with the latter proving to be more detailed and its spatial resolution presents many similarities to the original data. The 20 and 30 clusters are clearly more representative than the 10 cluster results.",

Cellular Automata (CA) has become a main tool to simulate and predict land use changes. But large-scale land-use change simulation with high-resolution data requires a large amount of data, complicated computing processes, and very long execution time. The data storage size can be hundreds of megabytes or even several gigabytes, we could consider these data as a kind of \u201cBig Data\u201d, therefore these big data also lead to the problems of computational capability. A computing model called GPU-CA model is proposed to use the graphics processing unit (GPU) high-performance technique to execute and accelerate such simulations. The comparison indicates that the GPU-CA model is faster than traditional CA by 30 times. Such improvement is crucial for land-use change simulations at large-scales using big data.",

        "abstract": "National data collected to aid understanding of spending patterns associated with food consumption and nutrition in the UK are reported in the Family Food module of the Living Costs and Food Survey. This survey data is used to better understand our society, including the geographies of food spending and informs the Consumer Price Indices. Such surveys require a nationally representative sample of volunteers to report their food spending and consumption patterns. This paper explores the role in which big data relating to food purchases could supplement such surveys and how reports using consumer data compare to survey data geographically.",

These data are then used to identify trip stops using a new method that employs a moving average position.  In total 12,849 stops are identified with a median time of one hour and a spatial distribution consistent with the travel diary data collected as part of the same study.",

The crime reports of 2012 were geocoded and the crime maps were prepared in ArcGIS 10. The strategic crime analysis was done in a series of meetings with police department and crime controlling strategies were built. The Compstat model with some modifications was followed for the accountability and performance management of police department. Operational analysis were carried out for resource allocations and deployment.  After implementing crime control strategies it has been observed that there was a remarkable reduction in the street crimes. The crime data of 2013 was plotted on map and the hotspot changing patterns were observed.",
