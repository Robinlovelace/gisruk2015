<a name="datadive">DataDitve - 17-19th April</a>
-----------------

Want to use your data skills to make the world a better place? Then
join us at the next DataDive in Leeds on April 17-19th. <a href="http://www.datakind.org/howitworks/datachapters/datakind-uk/">DataKind UK</a>, in
partnership with the Young Foundation, Leeds City Council and Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, is working with three local organisations to help
them understand and answer their data problems.

We will be working with Voluntary Action Leeds on their Young Lives
Leeds project to help them interpret the results from 10 focus groups
with young people. With another charity called Volition we will map the
mental health support services available in the city. And finally, we
will be working with the Money Information Centre at Leeds City Council
to understand the impact of tax and benefit changes on financial
security of Leeds residents.

If this sounds like your idea of fun then please join us! The event is
free and will take place at the ODI Leeds (Duke Street, LS9 8AG) over
the course of a weekend. You just need to bring your laptop and a
curious, data-savvy mind. You can sign up to take part here:
